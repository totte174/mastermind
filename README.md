# Mastermind Solver
This project is a [mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) solver algorithm I implemented in python an afternoon. Try it out!

## Usage
```bat
py mastermind.py
Make a code which consists of 4 numbers between 0 and 5.
My guess: [0, 0, 1, 1]
Result: 0,1
My guess: [3, 3, 2, 0]
Result: 0,2
My guess: [4, 2, 0, 2]
Result: 1,1
My guess: [2, 1, 3, 2]
Result: 1,2
My guess: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Result: 4,0
Wohoo! I won!
